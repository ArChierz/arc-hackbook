# Research

Vulnerability research provides awareness of advanced techniques to identify flaws or loopholes in the software that could be exploited. Using this information, you can use various tricks and techniques to launch attacks on the target system.

Vulnerability databases collect and maintain information about various vulnerabilities present in the information systems. The following are some of the vulnerability scoring systems and databases:

* Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)&#x20;
* Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)&#x20;
* National Vulnerability Database (NVD)&#x20;
* Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

***

## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

CWE is a category system for software vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It has numerous categories of weaknesses that means that CWE can be effectively employed by the community as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. Further, CWE has an advanced search technique with which you can search and view the weaknesses based on research concepts, development concepts, and architectural concepts.&#x20;

### Use CWE to view latest underlying system vulnerabilities&#x20;

Can explore more the CWE website and explore other options, as well. Attacker can find vulnerabilities on the services running on the target systems and further exploit them to launch attacks.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

CVE is a publicly available and free-to-use list or dictionary of standardizedidentifiers for common software vulnerabilities and exposures. It is used to discussorshare information about a unique software or firmware vulnerability, providesabaseline for tool evaluation, and enables data exchange for cybersecurity automation.

### Use CVE to view the latest underlying system and software vulnerabilities.&#x20;

## National Vulnerability Database (NVD)

NVD is the U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). Thesedataenable the automation of vulnerability management, security measurement, andcompliance. The NVD includes databases of security checklist references, securityrelated software flaws, misconfigurations, product names, and impact metrics. Use the NVD to view the latest underlying system and software vulnerabilities.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Hover over metric group names, metric names and metric values for a summary of the information in the official CVSS v3.0 Specification Document. The Specification is available in the list of links on the left, along with a User Guide providing additional scoring guidance, an Examples document of scored vulnerabilities, and notes on using this calculator (including its design and an XML representation for CVSS v3.0).
