# Assessment

A vulnerability assessment is an in-depth examination of the ability of a system or application, including current security procedures and controls, to withstand exploitation. It scans networks for known security weaknesses, and recognizes, measures, and classifies security vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and communication channels. It identifies, quantifies, and rank possible vulnerabilities to threats in a system.&#x20;

Additionally, it assists security professionals in securing the network by identifying security loopholes or vulnerabilities in the current security mechanism before attackers can exploit them.&#x20;

Two approach:&#x20;

* Active Scanning&#x20;
* Passive Scanning

## OpenVAS

OpenVAS is a framework of several services and tools offering a comprehensive and powerful vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management solution. Its capabilities include unauthenticated testing, authenticated testing, various high level and low level Internet and industrial protocols, performance tuning for large-scale scans, and a powerful internal programming language to implement any vulnerability test. The actual security scanner is accompanied with a regularly updated feed of Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs)—over 50,000 in total.

Provide:

Information, Results, Hosts, Ports, Applications, Operating Systems, CVEs, Closed CVEs, TLS Certificates, Error Messages, User Tags that you can look at and analysis those parts.

## Nessus

Nessus is an assessment solution for identifying vulnerabilities, configuration issues, and malware, which can be used to penetrate networks. It performs vulnerability, configuration, and compliance assessment. It supports various technologies such as OSes, network devices, hypervisors, databases, tablets/phones, web servers, and critical infrastructures. Use Nessus to perform vulnerability scanning on the target system.

## Nikto

Nikto is Open Source web server scanner that performs comprehensive tests against webservers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated version of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems onover270 servers. Also checks for server configuration items such as the presence of multiple index files and HTTP server options; it will also attempt to identify installed web servers and software.

Use Tuning option to do a deeper and more comprehensive scan on the target webserver. Tuning scan can be used to decrease the number of tests performed against a target. By specifying the type of test to include or exclude, faster and focused testing can be completed. This is useful in situations where the presence of certain file types such as XSS or simply “interesting” files is undesired.

### Availability options:

```
nikto -H
```

### Display Various Information

The result will displaying various information such as the name of the server, IPaddress, target port, retrieved files, and vulnerabilities details of the target website.

```
nikto -h [target] -Tuning x
```

> -h : specifies target host&#x20;
>
> x: Reveres Tuning Options.&#x20;
>
> Scan Approx. 10-20 minutes.

### Check for cgi directories

Check for cgi directories with -Cgidirs option to search for specific directories or useall options to search for all the available directories.

```
nikto -h [target] -Cgidirs all
```

> -Cgidirs: Scan specific CGI directories, can use filter “none” or “all”&#x20;
>
> Scn Approx. 10-15 minutes.

### Save the scan results in the form of a text file

```
nikto -h [target] -o [filename] -F [ext]
```

> -h: specifies target
>
> -o: specifies the name of the output file&#x20;
>
> -F: specifies the file format (txt,pdf,xls)
