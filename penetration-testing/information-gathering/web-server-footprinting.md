# Web Server Footprinting

By performing web server footprinting, it is possible to gather valuable system-level data such as account details, OS, software versions, server names, and database schema details. Use Telnet utility to footprint a web server and gather information such as server name, server type, OSes, and applications running. Use footprinting tools such as Netcraft and httprecon can extract information from the target server.

## Ghost Eye

Ghost Eye is an information-gathering tool written in Python3. TO run, only needs a domain or IP. Ghost Eye gathers information such as Whois lookup, DNS lookup, EtherApe, Nmap port scna, HTTP header grabber, Clickjacking test, Robots.txt scanner, link grabber, IP location finder, and traceroute.

## Skipfish

Skipfish is an active web application (deployed on a webserver) security reconnaissance tool. It prepares an interactive sitemap for the terageted site by carrying out a recursive crawl and dictionary-based probes. The resulting map is then annotated with the output from a number of active security checks. The final report generated by the tool is meant to serve as a foundation for professional web application security assessments.

```
skipfish -o /home/attacker/test -S /usr/share/skipfish/dictionaries/complete.wl [Target domain]
```

## httprecon

Web applications can publish information, interact with Internet users, and establish an e-commerce or e-government presence. However, if an organization is not rigorous in configuring and operating its public website, it may be vulnerable to a variety of security threats. Although the threats in cyberspace remain largely the same as in the physical world (fraud, theft, vandalism, and terrorism), they are far more dangerous. Organizations can face monetary losses, damage to reputation, and legal action if an intruder successfully violates the confidentiality of their data.

## nmap

Nmap, along with Nmap Scripting Engine, can extract a lot of valuable information from the target web server. In addition to Nmap cmd, Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) provides scripts that reveal various useful information about the target web server to an attacker.

### Enumerate the directories used by web servers and web applications

In real-time, attackers use various techniques to detect the vulnerabilities in the target web applications hosted by the web servers either to gain administrator-level access to the server or to retrieve sensitive information stored on the server.

Attackers use the Nmap NSE script http-enum to enumerate the applications, directories, and files of the web servers that are exposed on the Internet. Through this method, attackers identify critical security vulnerabilities on the target web application.

```
nmap -sV --script=http-enum [Target domain]
```

### Discover the hostnames that resolve the targeted domain

```
nmap --script hostmap-bfk -script-args hostmap-bfk.prefix=hostmap- [Target domain]
```

### HTTP Trace on the targeted domain

```
nmap --script http-trace -d [Target domain]
```

### Check whether WAF is configured on target domain

```
nmap -p80 --script http-waf-detect [Target domain]
```

## uniscan

Uniscan is a versatile server fingerprinting tool that not only performs simple commands like ping, traceroute, and nslookup, but also does static, dynamic, and stress checks on a web server. Apart from scanning websites, uniscan also performs automated Bing and Google searches on provided IPs. Uniscan takes all of this data and combines them into a comprehensive report file for the user.

### Display help options

```
uniscan -h
```

### Perform diffierent tests on the web server and search directories&#x20;

```
uniscan -u [target] -q
```

### Perform enumeration and directory brute-forcing

```
uniscan -u [target] -we
```

> -w: enable directory and file brute forcing
>
> -e: enumeration of possible vulnerabilities or attack vectors

### Dynamic testing

```
uniscan -u [target] -d
```
