# Various Tools for Analyze a Network

## OmniPeek

OmniPeek Network Protocol Analyzer provides real-time visibility and expert analysis of each part of the target network. It performs analysis, drills down, and fixes performance bottlenecks across multiple network segments. It includes analytic plug-ins that provide targeted visualization and search abilities.

An EH or pentester can use this tool to monitor and analyze network traffic of the target network in real-time, identify the source location of that traffic, and attempt to obtain sensitive information as well as find any network loopholes.

## SteelCentral Packet Analyzer

SteelCentral Packet Analyzer provides a graphical console for high-speed packet analysis. It captures terabytes of packet data traversing the network, reads it, and displays it in a GUI. It can analyze multi-gigabyte recordings from locally presented trace files or on remote SteelCentral NetShark probes (physical, virtual, or embedded on SteelHeads), without a large file transfer, to identify anomalous network issues or diagnose and troubleshoot complex network and application performance issues down to the bit level.
