## Wireshark

Wireshark is a network packet analyzer used to capture network packets and display packet data in detail. The tool uses Winpcap to capture packets on its own supported networks. It captures live network traffic from Ethernet, IEEE 802.11, PPP/HDLC, ATM, Bluetooth, USB, Token Ring, Frame Relay, and FDDI networks. The captured files can be programmatically edited via the cmd. A set of filters for customized data displays can be refined using a display filter. Especially in protocol that not secure, we could see inside the data that passing by and fetch them.



Could do **remote packet capture**.
