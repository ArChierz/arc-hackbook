# Detect Network Sniffing

This section helps to understand possible defensive techniques used to defend a target network against sniffing attacks.

A professional EH or pentester should be able to detect network sniffing in the network. A sniffer on a network only captures data and runs in promiscuous mode, so it is not easy to detect. Promiscuous mode allows a network device to intercept and read each network packet that arrives in its entirety. The sniffer leaves no trace, since it doesnâ€™t transmit data. Therefore, to detect sniffing attempts, you must use the various network sniffing detection techniques and tools discussed in this lab.

## Overview of Detecting Network Sniffing

Network sniffing involves using sniffer tools that enable the real-time monitoring and analysis of data packets flowing over computer networks. These network sniffers can be detected by using various techniques such as:

* **Ping Method**: Identifies if a system on the network is running in promiscuous mode
* **DNS Method**: Identifies sniffers in the network by analyzing the increase in network traffic
* **ARP Method**: Sends a non-broadcast ARP to all nodes in the network; a node on the network running in promiscuous mode will cache the local ARP address.
