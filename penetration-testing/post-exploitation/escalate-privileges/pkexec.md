# pkexec

**Polkit** or **Policykit** is an authorized API used by programs to elevate permissions and run processes as an elevated user. The successful exploitation of the **Polkit pkexec** vulnerability allows any unprivileged user to gain root privileges on the vulnerable host.&#x20;

In the **pkexec.c** code, there are parameters that doesnâ€™t handle the calling correctly which ends up in trying to execute environment variables as commands. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by designing an environment variable in such a manner that it will enable **pkexec** to execute an arbitrary code.&#x20;

Using Proof of Concept code to execute the attack on the target system and escalate the privileges from a standard user to a root user.&#x20;

In this task, exploiting pkexec **CVE-2021-4034** vulnerability that was shown in the task Perform Vulnerability Research in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE).

Before run, type this:

```
make
./cve-2021-4034
```

You can observe that we have successfully got root privileges in the Parrot Security machine without entering any credential. This vulnerability has already been patched in newer version of Unix-based operating systems. Here, we are exploiting the vulnerability for the sake of demonstrating how the attackers can search for the latest vulnerabilities in the target system using online resources such as Exploit-db and further exploit them to gain unauthorized access or escalated privileges to the target system.
