# Power Spy

Power Spy is a computer activity monitoring software that allows you to secretly log all users on a PC while they are unaware. After the software is installed on the PC, you can remotely receive log reports on any device via email or FTP. You can check these reports as soon as you receive them or at any convenient time. You can also directly check logs using the log viewer on the monitored PC.

#### Key Points to Keep in Mind:

* This task only works if the target machine I turned ON.
* Use Escalate Privileges technique then dump the password hashes
* On obtaining the hashes, use password cracking application such as Responder to obtain plain text passwords
* Once have the passwords, establish a Remote Desktop Connection as the attacker; install keylogger tools (Power Spy) and leave them in stealth mode
* Next is log on to the machine as a legitimate user, and as the victim, perform user activities as though you are unaware of the application tracking your activities
* After completing some activities, you will again establish a Remote Desktop Connection as an attacker, bring the application out of stealth mode, and monitor the activities performed on the machine by the victim (you).
