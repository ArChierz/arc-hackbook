# Hide data using White Space Steganography

Whitespace steganography is used to conceal messages in ASCII text by adding white spaces to the end of the lines. Because spaces and tabs are generally not visible in text viewers, the message is effectively hidden from casual observers. If the built-in encryption is used, the message cannot be read even if it is detected. To perform Whitespace steganography, various steganography tools such as snow are used.

**Snow** is a program that conceals message text files by appending tabs and spaces to the end of lines, and that extracts hidden messages from files containing them. The user hides the data in the text file by appending sequences of up to seven spaces, interspersed with tabs.
