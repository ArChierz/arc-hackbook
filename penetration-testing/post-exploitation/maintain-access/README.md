# Maintain Access

Can remotely execute malicious malicious applications such as keyloggers, spyware, backdoors, and other malicious programs to maintain access to the target system. You can hide malicious programs or files using methods such as rootkits, steganography, and NTFS data streams to maintain access to the target system.

Maintaining access will help you identify security flaws in the target system and monitor the employees computer activities to check for any violation of company security policy. This will also help predict the effectiveness of additional security measures in strengthening and protecting information resources and systems from attack.

* **Remote Access**: Remote code execution techniques are often performed after initially compromising a system and further expanding access to remote systems present on the target network.

RCE Techniques:

* Exploitation for client execution
* Scheduled task
* Service Execution
* Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
* Windows Remote Management (WinRM)
* **Hiding Files**: Hiding files is the process of hiding malicious programs using methods usch as rootkits, NTFS streams, and Steganography techniques to prevent the malicious programs from being detected by protective applications such as Antivirus, Anti-malware, and Anti-spyware applications that may be installed on the target system. This helps in maintaining future access to the target system as a hidden malicious file provides direct access to the target system without the victimâ€™s consent.



Can also use other spyware tools such as **ACTIVTrack**, **Veriato Cerebral**, **NetVizor**, **SoftActivity Monitor** to perform system monitoring and surveillance on the target system.
