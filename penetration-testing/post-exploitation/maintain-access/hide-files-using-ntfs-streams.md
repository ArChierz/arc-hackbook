# Hide Files using NTFS Streams

Must understand how to hide files using NTFS (NT file system or New Technology File System) streams. NTFS is a file system that stores any file with the help of two data stream, called NTFS data streams, along with file attributes. The first data stream stores the security descriptor for the file to be stored such as permissions; the second stores the data within a file. Alternate data streams are another type of named data stream that can be present within each file.

#### Steps:

* make sure the drive file system is in NTFS format
* create new folder (here is `magic`), paste a file that want to be hide. In here, the file is `calc.exe`
* open cmd on that path
* type `notepad readme.txt` to create a new file. Try add some text, then save and close.
* To hide it, type: `type c:\magic\calc.exe > c:\magic\readme.txt:calc.exe`&#x20;
* Now can delete the `calc.exe`file
* To execute the program, type `mklink backdoor.exe readme.txt:calc.exe`
* Then we can open this file using `backdoor.exe`
