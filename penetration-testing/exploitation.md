# Exploitation

System hacking is one of the most important steps that is performed after acquiring information through the above techniques. This information can be used to hack the target system using various hacking techniques and strategies. System hacking helps to identify vulnerabilities and security flaws in the target system and predict the effectiveness of additional security measures in strengthening and protecting information resources and systems from attack.

Four steps in the system hacking:&#x20;

* **Gaining Access**: Use techniques such as cracking passwords and exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to the target system&#x20;
* **Escalating Privileges**: Exploit known vulnerabilities existing in OSes and software applications to escalate privileges&#x20;
* **Maintaining Access**: Maintain high levels of access to perform malicious activites suchas executing malicious applications and stealing, hiding, or tampering with sensitivesystem files&#x20;
* **Clearing Logs**: Avoid recognition by legitimate system users and remain undetectedbywiping out the entries corresponding to malicious activities in the systemlogs, thusavoiding detection
