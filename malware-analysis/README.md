Malware poses a major security threat to information security. Malware writers explore new attack vectors to exploit vulnerabilities in information systems. This leads to ever more sophisticated malware attacks, including _drive-by malware_, ‚Äú_malvertising_‚Äù, and _Advanced Persistent Threats_. Although organization use high defense security, the current trend indicates that malware applications are targeting ‚Äú_low hanging fruit_‚Äù; these include unsecured smartphones, mobile applications, social media, and cloud services. This problem is further complicated, because of the challenges faced during threat prediction.

Assessing an organization‚Äôs information system against malware threats is a major challenge today, because of the rapidly changing nature of malware threats. One needs to be well-versed in the latest developments in the field and understand the basic functioning of malware to select and implement the controls appropriate for an organization and its needs.

* Attack browsers and track website visited
* Affect system performance, making it very slow
* Cause hardware failure, rendering computers inoperable
* Steal personal information, including contacts
* Erase valuable information, resulting in substantial data losses
