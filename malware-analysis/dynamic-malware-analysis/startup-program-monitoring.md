# Startup Program Monitoring

Startup programs are applications or processes that start when your system boots up. Attackers make many malicious programs such as Trojans and Worms in such a way that they are executed during startup, and the user is unaware of the malicious program running in the background.

An EH or pentester must identify the applications or processes that start when a system boots up and remove any unwanted or malicious programs that can breach privacy or affect a system’s health. Therefore, scanning for suspicious startup programs manually or using startup program monitoring tools like **Autoruns for Windows** and **WinPatrol** is essential for detecting malware.

## Autoruns for Windows

Autoruns’ Hide Signed Microsoft Entries option to helps the user zoom in on third-party auto starting images that add to the user’s system, and it has support for looking at the auto-starting images configured for other accounts configured on the system.
