# Port Monitoring

Malware programs corrupt the system and open system input and output ports to establish connections with remote systems, networks, or servers to accomplish various malicious tasks. These open ports can also act as backdoors or communication channels for other types of harmful malware and programs. They open unused ports on the victimâ€™s machine to connect back to the malware handlers.

Can identify the malware trying to access a particular port by installing port monitoring tools such as **TCPView** and **CurrPorts**.

## TCPView

TCPView is a Windows program that shows the detailed listings of all the TCP and UDP endpoints on the system, including the local and remote addresses, and the state of the TCP connections. It provides a subset of the Netstat program that ships with Windows. The TCPView download includes Tcpvcon, a cmd line version with the same functionality. When TCPView runs, it enumerates all active TCP and UDP endpoints, resolving all IP addresses to their domain name versions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Observe the protocols running on different ports under the **Protocol** column.
{% endhint %}

This way, you can view all processes running on the machine and stop unwanted or malicious processes that may affect your system. If you are unable to stop a process, you can view the port on which it is running and add a firewall rule to block the port.

## CurrPorts

CurrPorts is a piece of network monitoring software that displays a list of all the currently open TCP/IP and UDP ports on a local computer. For each port in the list, information about the process that opened the port is also displayed, including the process name, full path of the process, version information of the process (product name, file description, etc.), the time that the process was created, and the user that created it.

In addition, CurrPorts allows you to close unwanted TCP connections, kill the process that opened the ports, and save the TCP/UDP port information to an HTML file, XML file, or to tab-delimited text file.

CurrPorts also automatically marks suspicious TCP/UP ports owned by unidentified applications (apps without vers. Info and icon) in pink.

Each processs available, could view the properties by right click the process and click **Properties**. It will displaying information related to the process such as name of the process, its process ID, Remote Address, Process Path, Remote Host Name, and other details.
