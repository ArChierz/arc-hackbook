# Process Monitor

Process monitoring will help in understanding the processes that malware initiates and takes over after execution. You should also observe the child processes, associated handles, loaded libraries, functions, and execution flow of boot time processes to define the entire nature of a file or program, gather information about processes running before the execution of the malware, and compare them with the processes running after execution. This method will reduce the time taken to analyze the processes and help in easy identification of all processes that malware starts.

**Process Monitor** is a monitoring tool for Windows that shows the real-time file system, Registry, and process and thread activity. It combines the features of two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon. It adds an extensive list of enhancements including rich and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties such session IDs and user names, reliable process information, full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for each operation, and simultaneous logging to a file. Unique features of Process Monitor make it a core utility in system troubleshooting and vital to the malware hunting toolkit.

The process **Properties** will display the **Event Properties** which gave the details of the chosen process. There is 3 tabs, **Event, Process,** and **Stack**.

* **Event** tab: Complete details of the running process such as Date, Thread, Class, Operation, Result, Path, and Duration.
* **Process** tab: Complete details of the process running and its module used.
* **Stack** tab: View the supported DLLs of the selected process.

This way, you can analyze the processes running on a machine. If a process is found to be suspicious, you may either kill the process or close the port.&#x20;
