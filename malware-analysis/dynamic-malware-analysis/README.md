# Dynamic Malware Analysis

Dynamic Malware Analysis, also known as behavioral analysis, involves executing malware code to learn how it interacts with the host system and its impact after infecting the system.

Dynamic analysis involves the execution of malware to examine its conduct and operations and identify technical signatures that confirm the malicious intent. It reveals information such as domain names, file path locations, created  registry keys, IP addresses, additional files, installation files, and DLL and linked files located on the system or network.

This type of analysis requires a safe environment such as machines and sandboxes to deter the spreading of malware. The environment design should include tools that can capture every movement of the malware in detail and give feedback. Typically, systems act as a base for conducting such experiments.

Must perform dynamic malware analysis to find out about the applications and processes running on a computer and remove unwanted or malicious programs that can breach privacy or affect the system’s health.

## Overview

Dynamic analysis is performed to gather valuable information about malware activity, including the files and folders created, ports and URLs accessed, called functions and libraries, applications and tools accessed, information transferred, settings modified processes, and services the malware started, and other items. You should design and set up the environment for performing the dynamic analysis in such a way that the malware cannot propagate to the production network, and ensure that the testing system can recover to an earlier set timeframe (prior to launching the malware) in case anything goes wrong during the test.

To achieve that, need to perform:

* **System Baselining**, Baselining refers to the process of capturing a system’s state (taking snapshot of the system) at the time the malware analysis begins. This can be used to compare the system’s state after executing the malware file, which will help understand the changes that the malware has made across the system. A system baseline involves recording details of the file system, registry, open ports, network activity, and other items.
* **Host Integrity Monitoring**, this is the process of studying the changes that have taken place across a system or a machine after a series of actions or incidents. It involves using the same tools to take a snapshot of the system before and after the incident or actions and analyzing the changes to evaluate the malware’s impact on the system and its properties. In malware analysis, host integrity monitoring helps to understand the runtime behavior of a malware file as well as its activities, propagation techniques, URLs accessed,  downloads initiated, and other characteristics.\

  Host integrity monitoring includes:
  * Port monitoring
  * Process monitor
  * Registry monitoring
  * Windows services monitoring
  * Startup program monitoring
  * Event logs monitoring and analysis
  * Installation monitoring
  * Files and folder monitoring
  * Device driver monitoring
  * Network traffic monitoring and analysis
  * DNS monitoring and resolution
  * API calls monitoring
