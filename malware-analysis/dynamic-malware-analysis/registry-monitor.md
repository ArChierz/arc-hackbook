# Registry Monitor

The Windows Registry stores OS and program configuration details such as settings and options. If the malware is a program, the registry stores its functionality. When an attacker installs a type of malware on the victimâ€™s machine, it generates a registry entry.  One must have fair knowledge of the Windows Registry, its contents, and inner workings to analyze the presence of malware. Scanning for suspicious registries will help to detect malware. While most computer users generally do not do this, monitoring the registry entries is a great way to track any modifications made to your system.

Registry monitoring tools such as **Reg Organizer** provide a simple way to track registry modifications, which is useful in troubleshooting and monitoring background changes.
