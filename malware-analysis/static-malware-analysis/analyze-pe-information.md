# Analyze PE information

The Portable Executable (PE) format is the executable file format used on Windows OSes that stores the information a Windows system requires to manage the executable code. The PE stores metadata about the program, which helps in finding additional details of the file. For instance, the Windows binary is in PE format that consists of information such as time of creation and modification, import and export functions, compilation time, DLLs, and linked files, as well as strings, menus, and symbols.

**PE Explorer** lets you open, view, and edit a variety of different 32-bit Windows executable file types (PE files) ranging from common such as EXE, DLL, and ActiveX Controls to less familiar types such SCR (Screensavers), CPL(Control Panel Applets), SYS, MSSTYLES, BPL, DPL, and more (including executable files that run on MS Windows Mobile platform).
