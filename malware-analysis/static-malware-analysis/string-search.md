# String Search

Software programs include some strings that are commands to perform specific functions such as printing output. Strings communicate information from a program to its user. Various strings that could represent the malicious intent of a program such as reading the internal memory or cookie data, are embedded in the compiled binary code.

Searching through strings can provide information about the basic functionality of any program. During malware analysis, search for malicious strings that could determine the harmful actions that a program can perform. For instance, if the program accesses a URL, it will have that URL string stored in it. You should be attentive while looking for strings and search for the embedded and encrypted strings for a complete analysis of the suspect file.
