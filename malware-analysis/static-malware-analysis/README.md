# Static Malware Analysis

Attackers use sophisticated malware techniques as cyber weapons to steal sensitive data. Malware can inflict intellectual and financial losses on the target, be it an individual, a group of people, or an organization. The worst part is that it spreads from one system to another with ease and stealth.

Malware such as Viruses, Trojans, Worms, Spyware, and Rootkits allow an attacker to breach security defenses and subsequently launch attacks on target systems. Thus, to find and cure the existing infections and thwart future problems, it is necessary to perform malware analysis. Many tools and techniques exist to perform such tasks. Malware analysis provides an in-depth understanding of each individual sample and identifies emerging technology trends from large collections of malware samples without executing them. The samples of malware are mostly compatible with the Windows binary executable.

By performing malware analysis, detailed information regarding the malware can be extracted. This information includes items like the malicious intent of the malware, indicators of compromise, complexity level of the intruder, exploited vulnerability, extent of damage caused by the intrusion, perpetrator accountable for installing the malware, and system vulnerability the malware has exploited.&#x20;

Must perform malware analysis to understand the workings of the malware and assess the damage that it may cause of the information system. Malware analysis is an integral part of any penetration testing process.

:warning: Note:

It is very dangerous to analyze malware on production devices connected to production networks. Therefore, one should always analyze malware samples in a testing environment on an isolated network.

## Overview

Static Malware Analysis, also known as code analysis, involves going through the executable binary code without executing it to gain a better understanding of the malware and its purpose. The process includes the use of different tools and techniques to determine the malicious part of the program or a file. It also gathers information about malware functionality and collects the technical pointers or simple signatures it generates. Such pointers includes file name, MD5 checksums or hashes, file type, and file size. Analyzing the binary code provides information about the malwareâ€™s functionality, network signatures, exploit packaging technique, dependencies involved, as well as other information.

#### Some of Static Malware Analysis Techniques:

* File fingerprinting
* Local and online malware canning
* Performing strings search
* Identifying Packing and Obfuscation Methods
* Finding Portable Executable (PE) information
* Identifying File Dependencies
* Malware Disassembly
