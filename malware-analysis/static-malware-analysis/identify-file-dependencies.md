# Identify File Dependencies

## Dependency Walker

Any software program depends on the various inbuilt libraries of an OS that help in performing specified actions in a system. Programs need to work with internal system files to function correctly. Programs store their import and export functions in a kernel32.dll file. File dependencies contain information about the internal system files that the program needs to function properly; this includes the process of registration and location on the machine.

Find the libraries and file dependencies, as they contain information about the run-time requirements of an application. Then, check to find and analyze these files to provide information about the malware in the file. File dependencies include linked libraries, functions, and function calls. Check the dynamically linked list in the malware executable file. Finding out all library functions may allow guessing about what the malware program can do. You should know the various DLLs used to load and run a program.

Some of standard DLLs:

**The Dependency Walker** tool list all dependent modules of an executable file and builds hierarchical tree diagrams. It also records all functions that each module exports and calls. Further, it detects many common application problems such as missing and invalid modules, import and export mismatches, circular dependency errors, mismatched machine modules, and module initialization failures.
