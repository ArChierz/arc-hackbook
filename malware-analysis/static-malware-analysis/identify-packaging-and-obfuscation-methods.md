# Identify Packaging and Obfuscation Methods

## PEid

Attackers often use packing and obfuscation or a packer to compress, encrypt, or modify a malware executable file to avoid detection. Obfuscation also hides the execution of the programs. When the user executes a packed program, it also runs a small wrapper program to decompress the packed file, and then runs the unpacked file. It complicates the task of reverse engineers to determine the actual program logic and other metadata via static analysis. The best approach is to try and identify if the file includes packed elements and locate the tool or method used to pack it.

**PEid** is a free tool that provides details about Windows executable files. It can identify signatures associated with over 600 different packers and compilers. This tool also displays the type of packet used in packing a program.
