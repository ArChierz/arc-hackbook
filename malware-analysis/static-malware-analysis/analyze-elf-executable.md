# Analyze ELF Executable

## Detect It Easy (DIE)

The Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) is a generic executable file format in Linux Environment. It contains three main components including ELF header, sections, and segments. Each component plays an independent role in the loading and execution of ELF executables. The static analysis of an ELF file involves investigating an ELF executable file without running or installing it. It is also involves accessing the binary code and extracting valuable artifacts from the program. Numerous tools can be used to perform static analysis on ELF files.

**Detect It Easy (DIE)** is an application used for determining the types of files. Apart from the Windows, DIE is also available for Linux and MAC OS. It has a completely open architecture of signatures and can easily add its own algorithms for detecting or modifying the existing signatures. It detects a fileâ€™s compiler, linker, packer, etc. using a signature-based detection method.

### Feature

* **File info**: Observe information such as file name, size, MD5, SHA1, entropy, entry points, etc.
* **Hash**: View information related to hash &#x20;
* **Entropy**: Observe the status, size, and graph of entropy

Similarly can further explore other functions such as: **MIME, Hex, Signatures,** and **Demangle**.
